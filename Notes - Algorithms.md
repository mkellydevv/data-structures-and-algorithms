## Algorithms

### General

- DFS
- BFS
- Binary Search on arrays and trees
- Graph Traversal including Cyclic
- Sliding Pointer
- Recursion
- Inverting binary trees, reversing a linked list
- Tries (and Suffix Trees)
  - Text validation
- Heaps
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting Algos
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

### Specific

- **Triangular Number**
  - Time: O(1)
  - Like factorial, but with addition instead of multiplication.
  - (num) => (num \*\* 2 + num) / 2;
  - Ex. 5th triangular number is 15 (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm**
  - Time: O(v + e)
  - Finds the strongly connected components in a directed graph.
- **Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
  - Detects a cycle in a linked list.
