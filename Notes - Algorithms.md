### Specific

- **Triangular Number**
  - Time: O(1)
  - Like factorial, but with addition instead of multiplication.
  - (num) => (num \*\* 2 + num) / 2;
  - Ex. 5th triangular number is 15 (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm**
  - Time: O(v + e)
  - Finds the strongly connected components in a directed graph.
- **Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
  - Detects a cycle in a linked list.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
  - Time: O(v + e)
  - Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
- **A\* Algorithm**
  - Time: O(v + e)
  - Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
