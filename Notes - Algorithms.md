## Algorithms

### General

- DFS
- BFS
- Binary Search on arrays and trees
- Graph Traversal including Cyclic
- Sliding Pointer
- Recursion
- Inverting binary trees, reversing a linked list
- Tries (and Suffix Trees)
  - Text validation
- Heaps
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting Algos
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

### Specific

- **Kosaraju's Algorithm**
  - Time: O(v + e)
  - Finds the strongly connected components in a directed graph.
- **Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)**
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
  - Detects a cycle in a linked list.
